Heirarchy for Jekyll prjects

So something there is some setup that needs to be done:
    Delete the Minima theme from the gemfile and the config.yml
    Delete all of the posts in the post folder, but don't delete the folder
    change index.md to index.html

MainFolder
    _includes
        footer.html
        head.html
        header.html
    _layouts
        default.html
    _site
        index.html // this is the one that is autogenerated
    assets
        css
        img
        scss // assuming that you'll use Sass/Scss
    _config.yml
    .gitignore
    Gemfile
    Gemfile.lock
    index.html
=====================================
# Gemfile
// Delete the default theme
    source "https://rubygems.org"

    gem "jekyll", "3.5.0"
    gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

    # If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
    # uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
    # gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

    # If you have any plugins, put them here!
    group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
    end

    gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]

this is truly a test...
